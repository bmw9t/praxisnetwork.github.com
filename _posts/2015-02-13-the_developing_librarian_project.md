We, the Columbia University Libraries Humanities & History team, are committed to cultivating, exercising, and maintaining the knowledge and skills needed to support evolving modes of scholarship in our fields. One of those evolving modes, broadly known as the digital humanities, involves the planning and completion of projects in a manner that takes full advantage of the capabilities of emergent technologies. In order to prepare ourselves to provide support for such project-based work, we began the Developing Librarian Project in the spring of 2012. For two years we will be building a digital history of our neighborhood, Morningside Heights, as we learn the emergent technologies needed to do so. Here is where we tell the story of our journey.
