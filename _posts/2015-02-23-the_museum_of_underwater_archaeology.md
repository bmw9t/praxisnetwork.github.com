The Museum of Underwater Archaeology's mission is to assist and promote the use of the Internet by ethical professional, student, and avocational underwater archaeologists. In support of that goal the MUA helps underwater archaeologists present their research to the general public by creating web based museum style exhibits as well as announce their latest projects.
