The Digital Humanities Working group is a collective of teaching
faculty, library faculty, and information technology professionals with a
primary focus on bringing DH to the liberal arts classroom.   Our goal is
for DH to become so diffused throughout the curriculum that it no longer looks experimental.  We seek to graduate liberal arts students who possess not only information fluency, but the craft skills to make and manipulate digital artifacts.  For our humanities graduates, parsing large data sets in easily visualized and nuanced ways will become a standard skill, along with writing and critical thinking.
