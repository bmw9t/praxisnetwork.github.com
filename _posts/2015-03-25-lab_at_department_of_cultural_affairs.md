Lab at DCA is a civic staff incubator designed to meet the demands of 21st century municipal arts administration. Hosted by City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA), the Lab aims to cultivate agency-wide digital literacy and inspire sustainable innovative practices. Through a project-based curriculum guided by actual department needs, members of the Lab prototype new modes of civic engagement and public service, and foster collaborative opportunities across silos. The content and design of the Lab are licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 and shared online to encourage thought exchange and contribute to DCAâ€™s public mission.
