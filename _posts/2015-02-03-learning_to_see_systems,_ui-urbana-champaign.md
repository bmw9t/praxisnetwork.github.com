This program addresses a question held in common across multiple disciplinary domains:
How can we make visible the values and epistemologies embedded in complex technological systems? The program equips students to be effective critics of not only their chosen subjects of study, but of their own increasingly digital scholarly spaces.  Outcomes will include scholarly publications and presentations in traditional and experimental forms, a new digital tool made available to the public for use in scholarly research and publication, and a concluding symposium on the rise of the “Humanities Lab” as a space of experimentation for scholarly form, method and audience.
