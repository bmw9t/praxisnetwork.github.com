<div class="content">
<p>Since its 2010 launch, the Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative has been a platform for interdisciplinary scholarly collaboration in the domain of Cultural Heritage Informatics at Michigan State University. The initiative strives to equip students with the practical and analytical skills necessary to creatively apply information and communication technologies to cultural heritage materials, influence the current state of cultural heritage informatics, and become thought leaders for the future of cultural heritage informatics. 
</p>
<p>
Cultural Heritage Informatics Fellowships are a significant branch of the CHI Initiative. The primary goal of the fellowship program is to provide an opportunity for selected graduate students to collaboratively develop a significant and innovative cultural heritage informatics project. Through collaborative project development as well as guided instruction, fellows gain the theoretical and methodological skills necessary to creatively apply information, computing, and communication technologies to cultural heritage materials.
</p>
<p>
The second arm of the CHI Initiative is the fieldschool, an immersive summer program offered every other year to graduate and undergraduate students, as well as non-students that work in cultural heritage-related fields. Based on a pedagogical model central to the field of archaeology, CHI Initiative fieldschools are intensive theme-based programs that use collaborative project development to teach skills needed to build applications and digital user experiences that serve the domain of cultural heritage—skills such as programming, media design, project management, user centered design, digital storytelling, and more.

<p>Cultural Heritage Informatics Fellowships are open to MSU graduate students in departments and programs with an emphasis on cultural heritage, including Anthropology, History, Art History, Museum Studies, Historical and Cultural Geography, Classics, and more. Students enter with varying levels of technical skills and familiarity with possibilities for digital scholarship, and create projects that contribute to their course of study. The interdisciplinary nature of the program enables students to conceptualize their work in a broader framework that transcends disciplinary boundaries. 
</p>

<p>The biennial fieldschools admit a limited number of graduate and undergraduate students, and are also open to a limited number of non-students (specifically, professionals working in the field of cultural heritage, the digital humanities, information science, informatics, user centered design, user experience design, and similar fields). Instruction is provided by Ethan Watrall, and the session is enhanced by a partnership with the Michigan State University Campus Archaeology Program Fieldschool.</p>

<p>The Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative is directed by Ethan Watrall, who is also Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology and Associate Director of MATRIX: The Center for Humane Arts, Letters and Social Sciences Online at Michigan State University. His research interests fall in the domain of cultural heritage informatics, with particular focus on digital archaeology, serious games, and meaningful play for cultural heritage learning, outreach, and engagement. Because of the proximate relationship between the CHI Initiative and MATRIX, fellows also benefit from the expertise of MATRIX staff.

<h2>Structure</h2>

</header>
<div class="content">
<p>
During the one-year term of their fellowship, fellows receive a stipend of $2,000 per semester, as well as the opportunity to receive an additional $1,000 if they are appointed as assistants to the Cultural Heritage Informatics Fieldschool during the summer session. As the fellowship period draws to a close, they can also receive up to $1,000 in travel funding to present their work at professional conferences. The maximum total award is $6,000 for the year.
</p>
<p>
The details of each year are guided by the projects that the fellows conceptualize, which can be individual or collaborative. Fellows meet weekly for instruction, consultation, and discussion; as the year progresses, the weekly sessions shift from being fairly structured instructional meetings toward more free-form brainstorming, project updates, and troubleshooting. Fellows blog their progress throughout the year. By the end of the year, fellows complete a white paper that is released to the public; they publicly launch their project; and they aim to present the project at one or more professional conferences.
</p>
<p>
The fieldschool structure is centered on a tightly-focused immersive experience. Participants meet all day, five days a week, for approximately one month. Students are challenged to work collaboratively in order to brainstorm and conceive of the projects they will work on throughout the session. The model allows students to integrate the “theoretical” portions of the fieldschool (design research, user centered design, best practices, etc.) with the applied (development) portions of the fieldschool—thereby building applications that truly meet the needs of cultural heritage questions, challenges, and content.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.chi-initiative.research }}</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Fellows create innovative and vibrant digital projects that contribute new knowledge to their field of study, while also advancing the broader developments in cultural heritage informatics. Details about individual projects can be found on the <a href="http://chi.anthropology.msu.edu/blog/">CHI Initiative blog</a>. Some projects conclude as the students complete their programs of study, while others are likely to see continued development over longer periods of time.

<h2>Support</h2>

<div class="content">

<p>The Cultural Heritage Informatics Fellowship program is generously supported by the Michigan State University Graduate School,  The College of Social Sciences, and the Department of Anthropology, and is administered by the Department of Anthropology and hosted by MATRIX: The Center for the Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences Online.</p>
<p>
While internal funding shows a strong institutional commitment to the program, the relatively short funding cycles (two year periods) mean that longevity remains a concern.

Each year, Watrall refines the fellowship program based on lessons learned through the previous year’s cohort. He hopes to see a modest increase in the cohort size, as well as continued diversity of student backgrounds. He continues to improve the models for public engagement and presentation of the fellows’ work, and hopes to make that process more effective for fellows, who accomplish a great deal in a relatively short period. He hopes that the number and quality of the application pool continues to grow stronger as more graduate students see the importance of digital innovation in their work, and he hopes that strong cross-departmental connections continue to build over time.

<p>Considering developing a similar program? There are a number of advantages and tradeoffs of housing your initiative within a department, particularly if you hope to include students from multiple disciplines:</p>
<ul>

<li>If the program will be credit-bearing, as the fieldschool is, will the credits be useful to participants from other departments? What disciplinary methods might be unfamiliar to outside students?
</li>
<li>How do you appropriately set expectations and evaluate projects given students’ differing technical skills at the outset of the program?
</li>
<li>If a project is not completed by the end of the term, how will you assess progress, and how will you encourage students to continue moving toward their project goals after the fellowship period?

</ul>
