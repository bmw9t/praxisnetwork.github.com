# Praxis Network

This uses several different packages and relies on Ruby and Node.
Assuming you have both installed, you can get up and running with the
following:

```
$ bundle install
$ npm install -g browser-sync
```

To start up the server for development, simply type `foreman start`.

When you start the server, a web browser will launch at
`http://localhost:3000`. When you make any updates to CSS, HTML, or
JavaScript files, the browser will automatically refresh itself.
