# Program content

## Praxis Program
praxis-program:
  mission: 'To equip the next generation of knowledge workers for faculty positions and alternative academic careers at a moment when new questions can be asked and new systems built.'
  people: 'An annual cohort of six students from a variety of disciplines, directed by <a href="http://nowviskie.org">Bethany Nowviskie</a>. Fellows receive mentoring and instruction from Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff.'
  research: 'The first cohort prototyped <a href="http://prism.scholarslab.org/">Prism</a>, a digital humanities tool for collective reading, or "crowdsourcing interpretation." The second cohort is rethinking, revising, and extending the Prism framework.'
  support: 'Supported through its two-year pilot period by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Funding for the third and fourth years will come from the University of Virginia Library, which houses the program and also supports the <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a>.'
  directions: 'The curriculum will be adjusted continually, based on participant interest and the potential of various projects to make meaningful interventions in contemporary digital humanities discourse—which is construed as including both DH theory and praxis.'
  structure: 'This one-year funded fellowship features weekly meetings, a single, collaborative project common to all fellows and staff, and iterative, public sharing of outcomes and teaching materials.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'Keys for success include an investment of significant staff time for high-quality mentorship, adequate space for collaborative work, and flexibility to accommodate the various backgrounds and skill levels of the fellows.'

## CHI Initiative
chi-initiative:
  mission: 'To equip graduate and undergraduate students with the technical, creative, and practical skills necessary to apply information, communication, and computing technologies to cultural heritage materials and questions, influence the current state of cultural heritage informatics, and become thought leaders for the future of the field.'
  people: 'Directed by <a href="http://anthropology.msu.edu/blog/people/ethan-watrall/">Ethan Watrall</a>, the CHI Graduate Fellowship Program comprises a small cohort of graduate students from disciplines related to cultural heritage, while the CHI Fieldschool is open to graduate and undergraduate students, as well as existing professionals.'
  research: 'Fellows create innovative and vibrant digital projects that contribute new knowledge to their field of study, while also advancing the broader developments in cultural heritage informatics. Details about individual projects can be found on the <a href="http://chi.anthropology.msu.edu/blog/">CHI Initiative blog</a>.'
  support: 'Supported by internal funding from the MSU Graduate School, the College of Social Science, the Department of Anthropology, the Department of History, the Department of Writing, Rhetoric, and American Cultures, and University Outreach and Engagement.'
  directions: 'The program will be refined continually based on each year’s successes and challenges, as well as current best practices and development in the field, in order to create a sustainable and rigorous program in which fellows complete robust projects in their areas of interest.'
  structure: 'The two key programs are graduate fellowships, year-long funded opportunities to develop digital projects and skills; and fieldschool, a five-week theme-based immersive program for instruction and collaborative project development.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'Consider how to evaluate process-oriented work, and how the credits that students earn will counted by their departments. Also, keep in mind that certain disciplinary methods and paradigms may be unfamiliar for students.'

## Hope Mellon
hope-mellon-scholars:
  mission: 'To encourage scholarly collaboration among arts and humanities students and faculty; to strengthen engagement with digital humanities on the institutional level; to foster collaboration with other institutions; and to provide experiences and opportunities that will equip students for a variety of career options.'
  people: 'A highly selective undergraduate program directed by <a href="http://www.hope.edu/academic/english/about/facultyprofiles/pannapacker.htm">William Pannapacker</a>, the Mellon Scholars program also involves faculty representatives from all departments in the Arts and Humanities division of the college.'
  research: 'The first two cohorts have completed <a href="http://celebration.hope.edu/abstracts/listing_titles.asp?CELDEP_RID=1226">capstone projects</a> on a wide range of topics and presented them to the community, both within the institution and at broader conference settings. Future cohorts will have many options for the kinds of projects and research they undertake.'
  support: 'The program is currently funded by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, supplemented by internal funding to support faculty development.'
  directions: 'Signs of success would include: deeper faculty engagement with collaborative research and digital approaches; more applications to the program and improving completion rates; a growing variety of high-quality projects and presentations; and successful placement of graduates in appropriate career paths.'
  structure: 'This comprehensive six-course program includes a variety of modular options, including seminars, high-level courses with individual mentoring, faculty-led collaborative digital projects, and individual capstone projects; students are encouraged to present their work publicly.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'Faculty investment is among the most important factors for success, and helps ensure a successful student experience as well as institutional support.'

## CUNY GCDI
cuny-gcdi:
  mission: 'To develop and highlight a broad range of digital projects and resources at the CUNY Graduate Center, and to foster institutional change at the Graduate Center by heightening the public presence of its digital initiatives.'
  people: 'Directed by <a href="http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/members/admin/">Matthew K. Gold</a> under the purview of the Provost’s Office, the first cohort of digital fellows are doctoral students from a variety of backgrounds.'
  research: 'While the program is still in the early stages of development, the first cohort of fellows are leading a <a href="http://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/projects/">variety of innovative projects</a> to advance the digital initiatives of the Graduate Center.'
  support: 'Financial support for the program is completely internal to the Provost’s Office, which signals a strong institutional commitment.'
  directions: 'This new program is experimental, so many successes and challenges are anticipated. One hope is to retain some students in subsequent years to build up a base of knowledge and expertise.'
  structure: 'The program provides a one-year renewable fellowship with an expectation of 15 hours of work per week; fellows meet weekly to gain skills and discuss projects.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'The experimental nature of the program means that it is highly flexible, but also means that frequent evaluation and possible course-correction may be needed.'

## UCL DH
ucldh:
  mission: 'To equip students to work on problems that are interesting scholarship—both from a humanities perspective and from a computer science/engineering perspective.'
  people: 'This master’s-level program is highly interdisciplinary; students enter with a range of backgrounds and participate in modules across the faculties. The program is directed by is directed by <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/people/simonmahony">Simon Mahony</a>, with input from all of the UCLDH team.'
  research: 'Because the modules are brief and varied, students build a body of knowledge rather than focusing on a single project. As a whole, the Centre produces <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/projects">an impressive range of intellectually rich work products.</a>'
  support: 'While initial funding for the program has been provided by the university, the Centre for Digital Humanities—including the MA/MSc program—expects to become self-sustaining through student fees and research grants.'
  directions: 'Program leaders hope to expand collaboration to include more faculty and students, while sustaining high enrollment despite recent changes in fee structures at UK universities.'
  structure: 'Depending on background and goals, students work towards an MA or MSc degree during three terms of study. The first two terms consist of taught modules, while the third focuses on coursework, exams, and work placement. The remainder of the year is spent on an independent research project or dissertation.'
  nuts-and-bolts: 'As in any program that works across multiple departments and schools, it is critical to ensure that expectations for participation are clear from the outset.'
