<div class="content">
<p>The Praxis Program aims to produce humanities scholars who feel as comfortable writing and deploying software, and managing teams and budgets, as they do conducting original research in their disciplines. Begun in 2011 as a pilot program of the University of Virginia’s <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a>, Praxis is a radical re-imagining of digital humanities center-based teaching, training, and research. It complements the SLab's ongoing work with individual Graduate Fellows in Digital Humanities, a program begun at UVa Library in 2007—with the crucial difference that Praxis Program fellows work collaboratively on a single, shared project that could never be executed by one scholar alone. In this, their work is a closer match to the practices and ethos of Scholars’ Lab R&amp;D, the research-and-development team at the heart of the center.</p>
<p>The program was launched in the context of discussions hosted by the <a href="http://uvasci.org">Scholarly Communication Institute</a>, a ten-year Mellon-funded humanities think tank based in the Scholars’ Lab, which provides opportunities for leaders in academic disciplines, research libraries, advanced technologies, and higher education administration to develop innovative strategies to advance scholarly communication in the context of the ongoing digital revolution. <a href="http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/">Graduate education reform</a> is a critical component of SCI's final phase of work (concluding in 2013), with a major goal being to explore and test new programs for the education of scholars and scholarly communication professionals.</p> 
<p>UVa’s Praxis Program—like the Praxis Network itself—is designed as one of several new initiatives that help to survey needs and opportunities, develop and articulate new models, and foster the growth of collaborative networks among organizations, institutions, and sectors of the academy with a stake in graduate and professional methodological training in the humanities. SCI is partnering with the <a href="http://chcinetwork.org/">Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI)</a> and with <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/">centerNet</a>, an international network of digital humanities centers, to develop additional pilot programs by the end of the grant period.  But Praxis will endure as a key component of the Scholars’ Lab at UVa Library.</p>

<p>Praxis Fellows receive instruction and support from the Scholars’ Lab’s top-notch research and development team, which provides consultation, programming support, and infrastructure for innovative work in the humanities and social sciences. The fellows themselves represent a variety of humanities disciplines. While the program's first cohort was heavily weighted toward literary scholars, the second cohort is far more varied, and includes students with backgrounds in history, music, sociology, and philosophy. They join the program at various stages of their academic careers, and with a range of technical backgrounds. As they work together over the course of a year to conceptualize, design, construct, and deploy a humanities software tool, they build on their existing strengths while also gaining new skills in areas that are more challenging for them.</p>

<p>Praxis Program director <a href="http://nowviskie.org/bio/">Bethany Nowviskie</a> also directs the department of Digital Research and Scholarship at the University of Virginia Library and is president of the <a href="http://www.ach.org/">Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH)</a>. She holds a doctorate in English from the University of Virginia and has taught courses in writing, poetry, bibliography, and new media aesthetics and design. Nowviskie’s work at the UVa Library includes oversight of a “Digital Scholarship R&D” unit, as well as the Scholars’ Lab, which combines the services and resources of UVa’s former Etext, GeoStat, and Research Computing Support Centers. A practicing digital humanist since the mid-1990s, Nowviskie also serves on the steering committees of <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/">centerNet</a>, <a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/">MediaCommons</a>, and the <a href="http://adho.org/">Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO)</a>, and chairs the <a href="http://www.mla.org/comm_id">MLA’s Committee on Information Technology.</a></p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.structure }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>Following a competitive process for program admission (which includes group interviews), fellows participate in two hours of weekly meetings, and also commit to ten hours of Praxis-related work per week. A typical weekly meeting might include a <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/tutorials/">workshop or tutorial</a> on a specific topic, a session of collaborative coding and problem solving on software design or functionality, or high-level discussions that tease apart disciplinary assumptions and pedagogical or research goals. Between meetings, fellows can be found working in their dedicated grad lounge, where they may sketch website designs on a whiteboard, test out new ideas for the project, or work together to compose a conference proposal. Participants learn by building. The first Praxis Program  cohort prototyped <a href="http://prism.scholarslab.org/">Prism</a>, a digital humanities tool for collective reading, or "crowdsourcing interpretation." The second cohort is rethinking, revising, and extending the Prism framework.</p>

<p>Fellows also draft a <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter.html">charter</a> with guiding principles for shared goals and assumptions, attribution of credit, resolution of any potential conflict, and more. As the year goes on, they differentiate into project managers, coders, designers—the same kinds of roles that prevail in any real-world development team. As a result, not only are they learning specific skills and building a public project, they're also gaining crucial understanding of work environments and related soft skills that are typically not found in academic humanities departments.</p> 

<p>Throughout the process, fellows and R&D staff <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/praxis-program/">write blog posts</a> documenting their learning process, successes, and failures. Learning in public is a fundamental aspect of the Praxis Program, and one that can be highly challenging for humanities students accustomed to working privately and sharing only polished work. As students become more comfortable sharing their progress and missteps, they set a valuable example to the humanities community that parallels and interrogates an increasing emphasis on open-source and open-access knowledge products and models.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.research }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>Beyond the collaborative work of Prism, Praxis Fellows also produce innovative and rigorous individual projects, as do the faculty and staff of the Scholars’ Lab research and development team. In fact, one of the key components of all Scholars’ Lab staff time is an allowance of 20% of the work-week for their own, self-directed research and development activities. This time ensures that team members advance in their own scholarship and maintain a portfolio of new and engaging work. Because the open research time fosters creative thinking and experimentation, projects that begin as personal research often grow and evolve into larger-scale collaborative efforts involving the entire Scholars’ Lab team. (One recent example of this is <a href="http://neatline.org">Neatline</a>, a Scholars’ Lab tool for creating interlinked, interpretive timelines and maps.)</p>

<p>The Scholars’ Lab and Praxis Program fellows invite you to <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/praxis-program/">follow their ongoing work</a>—always in progress—as they explore what it takes to produce thoughtful  digital humanities scholars capable of owning their own infrastructure: scholars comfortable designing effective user experiences, writing and working with open source code, engaging broad audiences, managing teams and budgets, and theorizing their work within the rich tradition of humanities computing.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.support }}</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Because the Praxis Program was initially supported as a two-year, grant-funded pilot project, long-term funding sources may evolve. A third and fourth year will be supported by the University of Virginia Library. The Praxis Program is one piece of a much larger ecosystem of digital initiatives at the University of Virginia, and has quickly become an integral and valuable part of the contribution that the Scholars’ Lab is making to the humanities—not only because of the interpretive tool its fellows are developing, but also (and more broadly) because of the conversations it opens up and the model for innovative methodological training that the program provides.</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.directions }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>This program functions best with a small cohort, so dramatically increasing the number of fellows would be counterproductive. Instead, a measure of success will be: continued internal funding and financial sustainability; a growing applicant pool of highly-qualified students; fellows from an ever-wider range of disciplines; and the successful continuation of past fellows through their graduate programs and into careers of their choosing. Already, the two fellows from the first cohort who finished their degrees have been hired into positions that excite them and build on skills they developed in the Scholars' Lab. Others have joined local projects they would not have been qualified to contribute to. All credit the Praxis Program as having a significant positive effect on their employment opportunities and decisions.</p>

<p>Longer term, Nowviskie and the Scholars’ Lab team hope that the methods that make the Praxis Program unique today—collaborative learning and building, learning “in the open,” project-driven pedagogy and more—will become far more common across the landscape of humanities higher education.</p>

<h2>Nuts & Bolts</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.nuts-and-bolts }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">

<p>If you’re considering implementing something along the lines of the Praxis Program, there are a few things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>
While the fellows do develop a project, the primary purpose of the fellowship is pedagogical, and fellows should typically not work on projects that are ongoing within the department or center. Keeping this in mind, how much staff time can you divert from existing projects in order to provide fellows with the mentorship and guidance that they need?
</li>
<li>
If you are receiving funding from multiple sources, make sure that the expectations are clear and consistent across both internal and external sources.
</li>
<li>
Do the fellows have adequate multipurpose space available where they can brainstorm and work collaboratively?
</li>
<li>
A good deal of flexibility is required in order to accommodate fellows from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels. How will you ensure that fellows take ownership of the process and project, while still providing sufficient direction so that they do not feel lost or overwhelmed?
</li>
</ul>
