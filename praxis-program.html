<p class="intro">Based in the Scholars’ Lab, a space for digital projects and expert consultations at the University of Virginia Library, the Praxis Program brings together a small cohort of graduate students from a variety of humanities disciplines towork collaboratively on a digital tool to benefit humanities research and pedagogy.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.mission }}</p>
<p>The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets. Started in 2011 as a pilot program at the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia, Praxis is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars’ Lab, and is is meant to complement our work with Graduate Fellows in Digital Humanities, a program shortly entering its sixth year at UVa Library.</p>
<p><!--I'll also add a little more here about the relationships between SCI, Praxis, SLab, etc.--></p>

<h2>People</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.people }}</p>
<p>Bethany Nowviskie is Director of Digital Research and Scholarship at the University of Virginia Library and President of the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH). She holds a doctorate in English from the University of Virginia and has taught courses in writing, poetry, bibliography, and new media aesthetics and design. Nowviskie has been a practicing digital humanist since the mid-1990s, and serves on the steering committees of centerNet, MediaCommons, and the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO), and chairs the MLA’s Committee on Information Technology.</p>

<p>Nowviskie’s work at the University of Virginia Library includes oversight of the Scholars’ Lab, which combines the services and resources of UVA’s former Etext, GeoStat, and Research Computing Support Centers. The Scholars’ Lab hosts public programs on the impact of new media and methods on scholarship, and also sponsors a graduate fellowship program in addition to the Praxis Program. Nowviskie additionally manages a “Digital Scholarship R&D” unit, providing consultation, programming support, and infrastructure for innovative work in the humanities and social sciences.</p>

<p><!--I'll add more info about the R&D team and the fellows, so maybe add two paragraphs of lorem ipsum for length.-->Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.structure }}</p>
<p>Following a competitve process for program admission, the first meetings in the semester are exploratory and instructional. The fellows begin to think about and discuss the directions that they'd like the tool to take, while also receiving practical tech-based lessons from the R&D staff on topics like the command line, Ruby on Rails, GitHub, and more. Tech skills are one side of the equation, but just as important is the evolution of a coherent team structure. The cohort begins by drafting a charter with guiding principles for credit, conflict resolution, and more. As time goes on, they sort themselves into specific roles: project managers, coders, designers -- the same kinds of roles that prevail in any real-world development team. As a result, not only are they learning specific skills and building a public project, they're also gaining crucial understanding of work environments and related soft skills that are typically not found in academic humanities departments.</p>

<p>Fellows participate in two hours of weekly meetings, and also commit to ten hours of Praxis-related work per week. A typical weekly meeting might include a workshop or tutorial on a specific topic (as mentioned above), a session of collaborative coding and problem solving on Prism design or functionality, or theoretical discussions that tease apart disciplinary assumptions and pedagogical or research goals. Between meetings, fellows can be found working in their dedicated grad lounge, where they may sketch ideas on a whiteboard, test out new ideas, collaboratively draft text for a conference proposal or other purpose, or take a break, play Wii, and have some coffee between classes. As the semester progresses, both the meetings and the work time become more concretely focused on developing and refining their project, culminating in a communications strategy to accompany its public launch.</p> 

<p>Throughout the process, fellows and R&D staff write blog posts documenting their learning process, successes, and failures. They also post all of their code to GitHub -- not only the code for Prism itself, but also the exercises they complete as they learn to write in Ruby; introductory websites as they experiment with HTML and CSS; and individual projects that they may develop on the side. Learning in public is a fundamental aspect of the Praxis Program, and one that can be highly challenging for humanities students accustomed to working privately and sharing work only once it is complete and polished. As students become more comfortable sharing their progress and missteps, they set a valuable example to the humanities community that parallels an increasing emphasis on open-source and open-access knowledge products.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.research }}</p>
<p>Beyond Prism, our fellows are also producing innovative and rigorous projects of their own, as is the Scholars’ Lab research and development team. In fact, one of the key components of  all Scholars’ Lab staff staff time is an allowance of 20% of the work week for their own research and development work. This time ensures that the team members advance in their own scholarship and maintain their own portfolio of new and engaging work. Because the open research time fosters creative thinking and experimentation, projects that begin as personal research often grow and evolve into larger-scale collaborative efforts involving the entire Scholars' Lab team. (Neatline is one example of this.)</p> 
<p>We invite you to follow our work together (always in progress), as we see what it takes to produce thoughtful digital humanities scholars —- scholars comfortable designing effective user experiences, writing and working with open source code, engaging broad audiences, managing teams and budgets, and theorizing their work within the rich tradition of humanities computing.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.support }}</p>
<p>Because the Praxis Program was initially supported as a pilot project, long-term funding is currently an open question. While the undertainty does make sustainability a concern,  Nowviskie is confident that a lasting solution will be developed. The Praxis Program is one piece of a much larger ecosystem of digital initiatives at the University of Virginia, and is quickly becoming an integral and valuable part of the contribution that the Scholars’ Lab is making to the humanities -- not only because of the interpretive tool the fellows are developing, but also -- and more broadly -- because of the model for innovative methodological training that the program provides.</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.directions }}</p>
<p>The program functions best with a small cohort, so the goal won't be to grow to an enormous size. Rather, a measure of success will be continued funding and internal sustainability; an increasing applicant pool; fellows from an ever-wider range of disciplines; and the successful continuation of past fellows through their graduate programs and into the careers of their choosing. Already, the two fellows from the first cohort who finished their degrees have been hired into positions that excite them, and both credit the Praxis Program as having a significant positive effect on their employment opportunities and decisions.</p>
