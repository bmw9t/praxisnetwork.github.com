<p class="intro">Based in the Scholars’ Lab, a space for digital projects and expert consultations at the University of Virginia Library, the Praxis Program brings together a small cohort of graduate students from a variety of disciplines to work collaboratively on a digital tool to benefit humanities research and pedagogy.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.mission }}</p>
<p>The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets. Started in 2011 as a pilot program at the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia, Praxis is a radical re-imagining of the teaching and training offered in the Scholars’ Lab, and is is meant to complement ongoing work with the Graduate Fellows in Digital Humanities, which the UVa Library has offered since 2007.</p>
<p>The program was started as a pilot project of the Scholarly Communication Institute, a Mellon-funded humanities think tank that provides opportunities for leaders in scholarly disciplines, academic libraries, advanced technologies, and higher education administration to study, develop, and implement creative and innovative strategies to advance scholarly communication in the context of the ongoing digital revolution. The importance of rethinking graduate education was determined to be a critical component of SCI's final phase (concluding in 2013), with a major goal being to explore and test new programs for the education of scholars and scholarly communication professionals.</p> 
<p>The Praxis Program is designed to be one of several new initiatives that will survey needs and opportunities, develop and articulate new models, and foster the growth of collaborative networks among organizations, institutions, and sectors of the academy with a stake in graduate and professional methodological training in the humanities. SCI is partnering with the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes and with centerNet, an international network of digital humanities centers, to develop additional pilot programs by the end of the grant period.</p>

<h2>People</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.people }}</p>
<p>Bethany Nowviskie is Director of Digital Research and Scholarship at the University of Virginia Library and President of the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH). She holds a doctorate in English from the University of Virginia and has taught courses in writing, poetry, bibliography, and new media aesthetics and design. Nowviskie has been a practicing digital humanist since the mid-1990s, and serves on the steering committees of centerNet, MediaCommons, and the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO), and chairs the MLA’s Committee on Information Technology.</p>

<p>Nowviskie’s work at the University of Virginia Library includes oversight of the Scholars’ Lab, which combines the services and resources of UVA’s former Etext, GeoStat, and Research Computing Support Centers. The Scholars’ Lab hosts public programs on the impact of new media and methods on scholarship, and also sponsors a graduate fellowship program in addition to the Praxis Program. Nowviskie additionally manages a “Digital Scholarship R&D” unit, providing consultation, programming support, and infrastructure for innovative work in the humanities and social sciences.</p>

<p><!--I wonder if one of the R&D crew could write a good, pithy paragraph about how fantastic you all are? I don't quite have the right vocabulary to describe the expertise of the group.-->Praxis Fellows receive instruction and support from the Scholars’ Lab’s top-notch research and development team, whose recent projects include Neatline, Blacklight, and a variety of geospatial scholarship projects. Members of the R&D team are available to students and faculty for consultation on digital projects, some of which, along with projects developed during each staff member’s allotted 20% research time, have evolved to become broader efforts involving the group as a whole. </p>  

<p>The fellows themselves come from a range of backgrounds. While the first cohort was heavily weighted toward students in the English Department, in subsequent years students have come from backgrounds in history, music, sociology, art, and philosophy. They join the program at various stages of their academic careers, and with a range of technical backgrounds. As they work together over the course of a year, they build on their existing strengths while also gaining new skills and strategies to strengthen areas that are newer to them.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.structure }}</p>
<p>Following a competitve process for program admission, the first meetings in the semester are exploratory and instructional. The fellows begin to think about and discuss the directions that they'd like the tool to take, while also receiving practical tech-based lessons from the R&D staff on topics like the command line, Ruby on Rails, GitHub, and more. Tech skills are one side of the equation, but just as important is the evolution of a coherent team structure. The cohort begins by drafting a charter with guiding principles for credit, conflict resolution, and more. As time goes on, they sort themselves into specific roles: project managers, coders, designers -- the same kinds of roles that prevail in any real-world development team. As a result, not only are they learning specific skills and building a public project, they're also gaining crucial understanding of work environments and related soft skills that are typically not found in academic humanities departments.</p>

<p>Fellows participate in two hours of weekly meetings, and also commit to ten hours of Praxis-related work per week. A typical weekly meeting might include a workshop or tutorial on a specific topic (as mentioned above), a session of collaborative coding and problem solving on Prism design or functionality, or theoretical discussions that tease apart disciplinary assumptions and pedagogical or research goals. Between meetings, fellows can be found working in their dedicated grad lounge, where they may sketch ideas on a whiteboard, test out new ideas, collaboratively draft text for a conference proposal or other purpose, or take a break, play Wii, and have some coffee between classes. As the semester progresses, both the meetings and the work time become more concretely focused on developing and refining their project, culminating in a communications strategy to accompany its public launch.</p> 

<p>Throughout the process, fellows and R&D staff write blog posts documenting their learning process, successes, and failures. They also post all of their code to GitHub -- not only the code for Prism itself, but also the exercises they complete as they learn to write in Ruby; introductory websites as they experiment with HTML and CSS; and individual projects that they may develop on the side. Learning in public is a fundamental aspect of the Praxis Program, and one that can be highly challenging for humanities students accustomed to working privately and sharing work only once it is complete and polished. As students become more comfortable sharing their progress and missteps, they set a valuable example to the humanities community that parallels an increasing emphasis on open-source and open-access knowledge products.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.research }}</p>
<p>Beyond Prism, the Praxis Fellows are also producing innovative and rigorous projects of their own, as is the Scholars’ Lab research and development team. In fact, one of the key components of  all Scholars’ Lab staff staff time is an allowance of 20% of the work week for their own research and development work. This time ensures that the team members advance in their own scholarship and maintain their own portfolio of new and engaging work. Because the open research time fosters creative thinking and experimentation, projects that begin as personal research often grow and evolve into larger-scale collaborative efforts involving the entire Scholars' Lab team. (Neatline is one example of this.)</p> 

<p>The Scholars’ Lab and the Praxis Program invite you to follow their ongoing work in progress as they explore what it takes to produce thoughtful digital humanities scholars —- scholars comfortable designing effective user experiences, writing and working with open source code, engaging broad audiences, managing teams and budgets, and theorizing their work within the rich tradition of humanities computing.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.support }}</p>
<p>Because the Praxis Program was initially supported as a pilot project, long-term funding is currently an open question. While the undertainty does make sustainability a concern,  Nowviskie is confident that a lasting solution will be developed. The Praxis Program is one piece of a much larger ecosystem of digital initiatives at the University of Virginia, and is quickly becoming an integral and valuable part of the contribution that the Scholars’ Lab is making to the humanities -- not only because of the interpretive tool the fellows are developing, but also -- and more broadly -- because of the model for innovative methodological training that the program provides.</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.directions }}</p>
<p>The program functions best with a small cohort, so the goal won’t be to grow to an enormous size. Rather, a measure of success will be continued funding and internal sustainability; an increasing applicant pool; fellows from an ever-wider range of disciplines; and the successful continuation of past fellows through their graduate programs and into the careers of their choosing. Already, the two fellows from the first cohort who finished their degrees have been hired into positions that excite them, and both credit the Praxis Program as having a significant positive effect on their employment opportunities and decisions.</p>

<p>The Praxis Program is an outsanding example of a successful implementation of a radically new form of pedagogy.</p>
