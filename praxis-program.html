<h2>Mission</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.mission }}</p>
</header>
<p>The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets. Started in 2011 as a pilot program at the <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a> at the University of Virginia, Praxis is a radical re-imagining of humanities teaching, training, and research. It complements ongoing work with the Graduate Fellows in Digital Humanities, started at UVa Library in 2007.</p>
<p>The program was developed in response to discussions hosted by the <a href="http://uvasci.org">Scholarly Communication Institute</a>, a Mellon-funded humanities think tank that provides opportunities for leaders in scholarly disciplines, academic libraries, advanced technologies, and higher education administration to develop innovative strategies to advance scholarly communication in the context of the ongoing digital revolution. <a href="http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/">Graduate education reform</a> was determined to be a critical component of SCI's final phase (concluding in 2013), with a major goal being to explore and test new programs for the education of scholars and scholarly communication professionals.</p> 
<p>UVa’s Praxis Program—like the Praxis Network—is designed to be one of several new initiatives that will survey needs and opportunities, develop and articulate new models, and foster the growth of collaborative networks among organizations, institutions, and sectors of the academy with a stake in graduate and professional methodological training in the humanities. SCI is partnering with the <a href="http://chcinetwork.org/">Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI)</a> and with <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/">centerNet</a>, an international network of digital humanities centers, to develop additional pilot programs by the end of the grant period.</p>

<h2>People</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.people }}</p>
</header>
<p><a href="http://nowviskie.org/bio/">Bethany Nowviskie</a> is Director of Digital Research and Scholarship at the University of Virginia Library and President of the <a href="http://www.ach.org/">Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH)</a>. She holds a doctorate in English from the University of Virginia and has taught courses in writing, poetry, bibliography, and new media aesthetics and design. Nowviskie’s work at the UVa Library includes oversight of a “Digital Scholarship R&D” unit, as well as the Scholars’ Lab, which combines the services and resources of UVa’s former Etext, GeoStat, and Research Computing Support Centers. A practicing digital humanist since the mid-1990s, Nowviskie also serves on the steering committees of <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/">centerNet</a>, <a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/">MediaCommons</a>, and the <a href="http://adho.org/">Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO)</a>, and chairs the <a href="http://www.mla.org/comm_id">MLA’s Committee on Information Technology.</a></p>

<p>Praxis Fellows receive instruction and support from the Scholars’ Lab’s top-notch research and development team, which provides consultation, programming support, and infrastructure for innovative work in the humanities and social sciences. The fellows themselves represent a variety of humanities backgrounds. While the first cohort was heavily weighted toward students in the English department (as well as a student of art history), the second cohort is more varied, and includes students with backgrounds in history, music, sociology, and philosophy. They join the program at various stages of their academic careers, and with a range of technical backgrounds. As they work together over the course of a year, they build on their existing strengths while also gaining new skills in areas that are more challenging for them.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.structure }}</p>
</header>
<p>Following a competitve process for program admission, fellows participate in two hours of weekly meetings, and also commit to ten hours of Praxis-related work per week. A typical weekly meeting might include a <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/tutorials/">workshop or tutorial</a> on a specific topic, a session of collaborative coding and problem solving on Prism design or functionality, or high-level discussions that tease apart disciplinary assumptions and pedagogical or research goals. Between meetings, fellows can be found working in their dedicated grad lounge, where they may sketch website designs on a whiteboard, test out new ideas for the project, or work together to compose a conference proposal. 

<p>Fellows also draft a <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter.html">charter</a> with guiding principles for credit, conflict resolution, and more. As the year goes on, they differentiate into project managers, coders, designers—the same kinds of roles that prevail in any real-world development team. As a result, not only are they learning specific skills and building a public project, they're also gaining crucial understanding of work environments and related soft skills that are typically not found in academic humanities departments.</p> 

<p>Throughout the process, fellows and R&D staff <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/praxis-program/">write blog posts</a> documenting their learning process, successes, and failures. Learning in public is a fundamental aspect of the Praxis Program, and one that can be highly challenging for humanities students accustomed to working privately and sharing only polished work. As students become more comfortable sharing their progress and missteps, they set a valuable example to the humanities community that parallels an increasing emphasis on open-source and open-access knowledge products.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.research }}</p>
</header>
<p>Beyond Prism, the Praxis Fellows also produce innovative and rigorous individual projects, as do the members of the Scholars’ Lab research and development team. In fact, one of the key components of  all Scholars’ Lab staff staff time is an allowance of 20% of the work week for their own research and development work. This time ensures that team members advance in their own scholarship and maintain their own portfolio of new and engaging work. Because the open research time fosters creative thinking and experimentation, projects that begin as personal research often grow and evolve into larger-scale collaborative efforts involving the entire Scholars’ Lab team. (Neatline is one recent example of this.)</p> 

<p>The Scholars’ Lab and the Praxis Program invite you to follow their ongoing work—always in progress—as they explore what it takes to produce thoughtful digital humanities scholars: scholars comfortable designing effective user experiences, writing and working with open source code, engaging broad audiences, managing teams and budgets, and theorizing their work within the rich tradition of humanities computing.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.support }}</p>
</header>
<p>Because the Praxis Program was initially supported as a pilot project, long-term funding is currently an open question. While the undertainty does make sustainability a concern,  Nowviskie is confident that a lasting solution will be developed. The Praxis Program is one piece of a much larger ecosystem of digital initiatives at the University of Virginia, and is quickly becoming an integral and valuable part of the contribution that the Scholars’ Lab is making to the humanities—not only because of the interpretive tool the fellows are developing, but also—and more broadly—because of the model for innovative methodological training that the program provides.</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.praxis-program.directions }}</p>
</header>
<p>The program functions best with a small cohort, so dramatically increasing the number of fellows would be counterproductive. Instead, a measure of success will be continued funding and internal sustainability; a growing applicant pool of highly-qualified students; fellows from an ever-wider range of disciplines; and the successful continuation of past fellows through their graduate programs and into careers of their choosing. Already, the two fellows from the first cohort who finished their degrees have been hired into positions that excite them, and both credit the Praxis Program as having a significant positive effect on their employment opportunities and decisions.</p>

<p>Longer term, Nowviskie and the Scholars’ Lab team hope that the methods that make the Praxis Program unique today—collaborative learning and building, learning in the open, project-driven pedagogy and more—will become far more common across the landscape of humanities higher education.</p>
