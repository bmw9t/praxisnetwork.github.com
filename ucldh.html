<p>Following the launch of UCL’s Centre for Digital Humanities in 2009, the modular MA/MSc program was developed in 2011 as a way to provide a robust education in the digital humanities while accommodating the differing inflections from which it can be approached. 
</p>
<p>By drawing together a wide range of disciplines, the program aims to produce applications and models that make possible new kinds of research, both in the humanities disciplines and in computer science and its allied technologies. Students enter with degrees either in the humanities or in a computing discipline, and through the Master’s program, they have the opportunity to round out their education by taking courses outside their main discipline, while also deepening their core focus.

<p>The flexibility of the program means that high-achieving students from a wide range of backgrounds can construct useful and stimulating courses of study that deepen their knowledge and skills in areas of strength, while also giving them introductory-level courses in new areas. To date, most students have entered with a background in humanities study; however, as the program matures, it may attract a larger number of students from computing and technical backgrounds. The current cohort size is about twenty students.

<p>Centered in the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/">Department of Information Studies</a>, the Centre for Digital Humanities (including the MA/MSc program) is co-directed by Dr. Claire Warwick and Dr. Melissa Terras. 
</p>


<p>Warwick is also Head of the Department of Information Studies; Professor of Digital Humanities; and Vice-Dean for Research for the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. She is particularly interested in the way that digital resources are used in the humanities and cultural heritage; in the use of social media in these areas; and in reading behaviour in physical and digital spaces. She serves on the advisory board for Digital Manuscripts to Europeana (DM2E) and is a member of the Comité Scientifique du Fondation Campus Condorcet.
</p>
<p>In addition to her role as co-director of the Centre for Digital Humanities, Terras is also Reader in Electronic Communication (UCL Department of Information Studies), and Member of UCLDH Public Engagement Subgroup. Her research interests involve applying computational technologies to humanities problems, to allow research that would otherwise be impossible. She is general editor of Digital Humanities Quarterly; Secretary of the Association of Literary and Linguistic Computing; and serves on the executive committee of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations.

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.ucldh.structure }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>The three-term modular program allows students to build a customized trajectory suited to their needs and interests while also gaining a number of core competencies. The courses are taught across a number of different faculties, including Arts and Humanities, Social and Historical Sciences, Engineering, and the Built Environment, and also partners with UCL’s special collections, museums, and libraries for a rich interdisciplinary experience. 
</p>
<p>
The first two terms comprise a number of required modules that focus on key areas such as digital resources in the humanities, programming and database querying, XML, and server programming. Students have the opportunity to substitute these basic courses with more advanced modules depending on their existing strengths and expertise, and all students take an additional module as an elective. Following two terms of coursework, students have a final term of synthesis and application. The focus during the third term is twofold: students write an original thesis, and they also undertake a work placement at a related institution where they can apply the skills learned in the first two terms while also gaining new and deeper understanding beyond the classroom walls.

<h2>Research</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.ucldh.research }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>Because of its modular nature, students in the MA/MSc program do not typically complete large or complex digital products during their terms of study. The capstone project is a written thesis designed to encourage students to synthesize the varied courses that they have completed; it is complemented by a work experience that allows students to apply those skills and methods in real-world settings.  
</p>
<p>At the same time, doctoral students, faculty, and staff at the Centre for Digital Humanities constantly engage in innovative, public-facing work, which contributes to the learning environment of the Master’s students. Past projects have focused on topics like human-computer interaction, longitudinal research, social interpretation, text analysis, and more; they have involved working with a wide range of materials, including manuscripts, archeological artifacts, census data, and ultrasound imagery.

<h2>Support</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.ucldh.support }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>The program’s initial development was supported by internal funding from University College London; however, Terras and Warwick anticipate that the program will soon become self-sustaining through research grants and student fees. As a fully integrated Master’s program in the UCL system, the MA/MSc in Digital Humanities is a fee-based program, with separate cost structures for UK and international students. The advantage of this structure is that the program can plan for longevity in ways that would be difficult without a long-term stream of support.

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.ucldh.directions }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>The MA/MSc program benefits from robust institutional involvement throughout the MSc system, and Warwick and Terras hope to see the program expand in coming years. They hope to do this by continuing to build strong relationships with departments across the UCL system, with cultural heritage institutions, and with individual faculty members that are willing to open their courses to interdisciplinary students. Because the program is supported by student fees, from a financial standpoint it should be possible to scale up the program—though additional staff may be required to keep the program running smoothly. Warwick and Terras also hope that it may be possible to add postdoctoral and research positions in the future.
</p>
<p>The program may be affected by factors outside its control, particularly as higher education in the UK is undergoing a great deal of change at the moment. Graduate education is becoming more expensive for students, so expanding enrollment may prove to be a challenge.

<h2>Nuts & Bolts</h2>
<p class="program-category-intro">{{ site.ucldh.nuts-and-bolts }}</p>
</header>
<div class="content">
<p>One of the most important factors for success in this model is the collaboration of many different departments and faculty members. Ceding classroom spaces to students from other programs may not be appealing in some instances, so it is crucial to set clear expectations and to understand the motivations and consequences of all involved. With successful employment being a major goal following graduation, the partnerships with cultural heritage institutions and other potential employers has been incredibly valuable. Some of the most significant challenges of administering the program are also the strongest draws for many students, so working to find satisfying outcomes has helped to strengthen the program in many ways.
