<section id="introduction">
<p class="intro">The Praxis Network is <strong>a suite of differently-inflected programs </strong>providing <strong>innovative methodological training and research support</strong> for humanities graduate and undergraduate students in order to equip them for scholarship and future careers. If you're considering developing a similar program, or if you'd simply like to know more about existing developments, we invite you to explore the site and find out more about the successes, challenges, and structures of this collection of groundbreaking models.</p> 
<p>The links in this section will take you to in-depth profiles of each Praxis Network participating program. If you'd prefer to see how the programs compare to one another, start with the “Categories” section, below.</p> 
{% include program-nav.html %}

<p>The featured programs represent some of the patterns and idiosyncrasies new programs with similar goals are likely to face. By sharing information publicly, we hope to make it easier for others who may wish to establish similar programs to establish good practices and to navigate common challenges.</p>

<p>Each of the programs featured here was developed independently in a unique ecosystem of disciplinary expectations, institutional needs, resources, and leadership. Each has also confronted a unique set of challenges. Select a link below to compare programs in the network across the following categories.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This informal network was developed as part of the Scholarly Communication Institute's 2012-2013 work stream on rethinking graduate education, which aspires to think through the emerging literacies necessary in humanities disciplines, the post-graduate career opportunities for students, and the best ways of providing methodological training and research support in light of both disciplinary and post-graduate needs. It complements a survey of perceptions of career preparation among humanities graduate students and their employers, as well as a series of meetings that SCI is convening in partnership with the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI) and centerNet, an international network of digital humanities centers.</p>
