<p class="intro">The Praxis Network: Equipping humanities graduate and undergraduate students for scholarship and future careers through innovative methodological training and research support. </p>
<p>The Praxis Network is a suite of allied but differently-inflected initiatives that are rethinking the modes of humanities education. Each of the programs featured here has been developed within a unique ecosystem of disciplinary expectations, institutional needs, resources, leadership, and challenges. Keep reading to see how the programs compare to one another across a number of categories, or click a program name below for an in-depth profile. </p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This informal network was developed with funding from the <a href="http://mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> as part of the <a href="http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/">Scholarly Communication Institute's 2012-2013 work stream on rethinking graduate education.</a> The collection of programs highlights several possible responses to the emerging literacies necessary in humanities disciplines, as well as the changing post-graduate career opportunities for students. It complements a <a href="http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/who-we-are">survey on perceptions of career preparation</a> among humanities graduate students and their employers, as well as a series of meetings that SCI is convening in partnership with the <a href="http://chcinetwork.org/">Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI)</a> and <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/">centerNet</a>, an international network of digital humanities centers.</p>
